Product listing app built with Vite + React. It reads a local product dataset, renders items in a responsive grid, and lets users search, filter, and sort the list. The app uses component-based UI, React hooks, and CSS-in-JS for inline styles.

Data model (example)
- id: string
- title: string
- sku: string
- description: string
- price: number
- category: string
- tags: string[]
- rating: number (0-5)
- inStock: boolean
- image: string (URL or local path)
This shape leads to predictable filters and quick rendering in ProductCard.

Filtering behavior
- Category: single or multi-select list. Filters use exact match.
- Price: min/max range. Filter uses numeric comparison.
- Rating: minimum rating. Filter includes equal or greater.
- Availability: toggle for in-stock items.
- Tag search: matches any product tag.
Combine filters using logical AND. The filters pipeline applies search first, then filters, then sorting, then pagination.

Search design
- Live search runs on the client against the local dataset.
- The app debounces input (200‚Äì300 ms) to avoid excessive re-render.
- The search performs case-insensitive match on title, sku, and tags.
- The search returns exact and partial matches. Results show matched terms highlighted.

Sorting options
- Price: low ‚Üí high, high ‚Üí low.
- Newest: uses createdAt timestamp on dataset.
- Popularity: uses a popularity score on dataset or fallback to rating.
- Default sort: relevance to search, then configured fallback.

Performance notes
- Vite provides fast HMR. React re-renders only changed components.
- ProductGrid supports basic virtualization if dataset grows beyond a few hundred items.
- Inline CSS-in-JS keeps style local to components and avoids global conflicts.

Styling approach
- Use lightweight CSS-in-JS for predictable style scoping.
- Keep rules small. Use flexbox and CSS grid for layout.
- Use tokens from theme.js for colors and spacing.

Accessibility
- All interactive controls expose proper aria-label attributes.
- ProductCard images include alt text.
- Keyboard navigation works for filters and product controls.

Testing
- Unit test components with Jest + React Testing Library.
- Test search and filter logic in hooks.
- Example scripts:
  - npm run test
  - npm run test:watch

Scripts (package.json)
- dev: vite
- build: vite build
- preview: vite preview
- test: jest
- lint: eslint . --ext .js,.jsx

Extending the app
- Replace local data with a real REST or GraphQL API. Abstract data access into src/services/api.js.
- Add authentication and cart features.
- Add server-side rendering for SEO.
- Swap CSS-in-JS for Tailwind or CSS Modules if you prefer.

Common tasks
- Add a new product: append to src/data/products.json with the model fields.
- Add a filter: create a small control and hook it into useFilters.js.
- Add analytics: place tracking inside ProductCard click handler.

Contributing
- Open an issue for a bug or feature.
- Fork, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request.
- Keep changes small and focused. Provide tests when appropriate.
- Follow existing code style. Use eslint and prettier.
